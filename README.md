# Speedy

### This game is my first experience in creating PC 2D games with ```Python``` and ```pygame```. 

### The game was created merely by myself. It is not inovatory one and it's not supposed to be such. It is a simple racing 2D game, wich remains those "old good times" when you did not need to have an extra-class video card to run games. 

### While coding these game my goal was to learn the mechanisms of Python and game "physics".
