# Speedy

### This game is my first experience creating PC 2D games with ```Pyton``` and ```pygame```. 

### The game was created on my own. It is not inovatory and it is not suppose to be such. It is simple racing 2D game, wich remains those "good times" when we do not have to have an extra-class dedicated video card to run games. 

### While coding it my goal was to learn mechanisms of Python and game "physics".
